# ErgoDox EZ - nyarly style

This is based on the configuration I started with on an Infinity board,
and warped by using an Atreus for a couple of months as my main board.

It's informed by programming and using the shell an awful lot, so e.g.
tab is very accessible, moreso than control.
Modifiers all live on the thumb clusters,
with Alt and Control checkerboarded with layer momentaries,
which makes for so nice "heel-toe" action for certain chords.

There's a "coder's" layer, and a numpad.
In the symbols layer on the other hand is motion (arrows, page-up etc),
and on the number pad layer are the number symbols, reflected.
